Some weights of RobertaForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at DeepChem/ChemBERTa-5M-MTR and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
